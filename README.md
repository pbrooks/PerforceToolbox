# Perforce Toolbox

When determining changes between perforce streams, syntax can become a blocker for quick introspection.
Within this shell script, accessors are given to speed up with pre-defined environments.

## Setup
Within your shell environment, define variables:

- export MASTER_STREAMROOT="//TheDepotRoot"
- export MASTER_P4CLIENT="TheClientWithMaster

## Running
Source the shell scripts
```
source .Toolbox
```
